## 1. Verify sender's email address

The sender's origin contains 2 parts: The display name and email@domain.com.
```
Nhat Vo <nhat.vo@awakenservices.net>

Display name: Nhat Vo
Email address: nhat.vo@awakenservices.net
```

The display name can be forged while email address cannot.
```
This is an example of phishing emails:
Nhat Vo <nhat.vo@123456.com>

Display name: Nhat Vo 
Email address: nhat.vo@12345.com
```

## 2. Don't Trust Unsolicited Emails

Be cautious of unexpected emails, especially those requesting personal information or urging you to click on links. Verify the legitimacy of the email by contacting the sender through a trusted method.

## 3. Look for Spelling and Grammar Errors

Phishing emails often contain spelling and grammar mistakes. Legitimate organizations usually have professional communication.

## 4. Avoid Clicking on Suspicious Links

Hover over links to preview the actual URL before clicking. If the link address looks suspicious or doesn't match the expected destination, avoid clicking.

## 5. Verify Requests for Sensitive Information

Legitimate organizations will not ask for sensitive information like passwords or credit card details via email. If in doubt, contact the organization directly using official contact information.
