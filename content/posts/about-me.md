Hi, my name is Nhat Vo. I'm an IT Officer and off-seasoned Software Dev with a keen interest in cloud technology (especially AWS). This blog will be my jounal where I would write about my personal cloud projects and anything IT related.

When I'm away from the keyboard, I like to tinker with my car and travel with my favorite people.

Thank you for visiting!

NV
